### Pre development

I wrote out notes and created a flow chart. All I had to do then is follow my notes and code one area at a time before moving on to the next. I set up projects in GitHub to write out work that needed to be done. The aim is to provide early and continuous delivery of the project. Through out the project I did make some changes that are not in the notes.
